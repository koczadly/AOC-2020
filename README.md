## Advent of Code 2020 Solutions (Java)
Here are my Java solutions for the 2020 Advent of Code challenge. I'll be attempting every star available, but don't
 expect perfect or reliable code.

You can attempt these awesome puzzles for yourself at https://adventofcode.com/2020.

## Technicalities
Be aware that the inputs can differ between user accounts, and may not emit the correct solution for you (unless you
 swap the input files).

These solutions will be written using Java 8, and will make heavy use of the Streams API.

The [`Helper`](src/main/java/uk/oczadly/karl/aoc20/Helper.java) class is used to load the input data into the
 application, which are stored as plain text files under the [resources](src/main/resources/inputs) path.
